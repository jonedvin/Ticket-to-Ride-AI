Optimize find possible routes

Don't try tunnels unless you have an extra card

Buy routes based on opponents predicted path

Smarter usage of cards on hand

Only buy tickets if there's more than X trains left for each player

Make AI.draw_tickets combine tickets if more than one is to be drawn

AI should prioritize using locomotives where they're necessary

AI must not draw grey, using other colors instead on these routes

Improve ticket complete check -> store ticket path?

Look for better way of stopping all recursive calls of function




TODO:
- AI.draw_tickets: replace sorting block with sorted function 
- Grey is not it's own color...
- Deal with destinations being impossible to reach
- Add undo button
- Add AI personality (TicketTrainLimit, longest route tactics etc.)
