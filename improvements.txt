TODO:
- Add undo button
- Deal with destinations being impossible to reach


OPTIMIZATIONS:
- Optimize find possible routes
    '- expanding max distance
    '- A*
- Only buy tickets if there's more than X trains left for each player
- Don't try tunnels unless you have an extra card
- Ranger ruter etter hvor lang omvei man får hvis man ikke kjøper den
- AI should prioritize using locomotives where they're necessary
- Make AI.draw_tickets combine tickets if more than one is to be drawn
- Improve ticket complete check -> store ticket path?
- Look for better way of stopping all recursive calls of function
- Smarter usage of cards on hand
- Buy routes based on opponents predicted path
- Add AI personality (TicketTrainLimit, longest route tactics etc., prioritize length vs points)
