Optimize find possible routes
    '- expanding max distance
    '- A*

Don't try tunnels unless you have an extra card

Buy routes based on opponents predicted path

Smarter usage of cards on hand

Only buy tickets if there's more than X trains left for each player

Make AI.draw_tickets combine tickets if more than one is to be drawn

AI should prioritize using locomotives where they're necessary

AI must not draw grey, using other colors instead on these routes

Improve ticket complete check -> store ticket path?

Look for better way of stopping all recursive calls of function




TODO:
- Set ticket to complete when done
- AI.draw_tickets: replace sorting block with sorted function 
- Deal with destinations being impossible to reach
- Add undo button


Seems to be able to notice when it's completed a ticket
For some reason buys irrelevant routes sometimes 
    - (when working on the 3rd ticket, it bought routes further connecting the first two routes)
